# Lunacid Quality of Life (QoL) Mod

## Current features:
- Projectiles no longer phase through walls

## Installation:
- Install BepInEx for Lunacid: https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html
- Download and extract the repo
- Open the .csproj and build using an IDE 
- Copy the resulting LunacidQoL.dll into BepInEx/plugins alongside MMHOOK_Assembly-CSharp.dll

### In the future, it would also be nice to fix the following problems:
- Elevators causing jitter when going up and down
- Broken lighting in hub
- Crossbow not lining up with crosshair

### More info:
- This is an example of a Lunacid mod using MMHOOK (generated using https://github.com/Hamunii/BepInEx.MonoMod.AutoHookGenPatcher)
